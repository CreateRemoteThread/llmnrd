llmnrd - Link-Local Multicast Resolution Daemon
===============================================

llmnrd is a daemon implementing the Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)
protocol according to RFC 4795. It currently only supports Linux, as it uses the
netlink kernel interface.

Installation
------------

To build and install llmnrd use the following commands:

  $ make
  $ sudo make install

By default, the llmnrd binary will be installed to /usr/local/sbin. To install
the binary to a different installation path, use:

  $ make
  $ sudo make prefix=<path> install

Cross-Compilation
-----------------

To cross-compile llmnrd for a different architecture, use the CROSS_COMPILE make
variable. To e.g. build it using the arm-linux-gnueabihf toolchain use:

  $ make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-

When cross-compiling, you usually don't want to install the generated binary to
your root filesystem, but to the sysroot of a cross-compiled system. Use the
DESTDIR variable to change the installation destination path, e.g.

  $ make DESTDIR=$HOME/sysroot/ prefix=/usr install
